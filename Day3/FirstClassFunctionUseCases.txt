The use cases of First class functions are as follows :

1 : Passing behaviour instead of variables in function arguments, enabling true functional programming.
2 : Writing quick startup/shutdown functionality which doesn't need to have a name.
3 : Writing non-reusable code, which is only intended for use in a particular class.
